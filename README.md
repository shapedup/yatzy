# yatzy
Python - Yatzy dice game

Introducing the game of Yatzy to the REPL. Part of the files are worked through via the course bringing all subjects covered
in that part of the course together; subclasses, __init__'s, super()'s, @property decorators etc. The course leaves us with the
several remaining challenges:
  * as a user, you should be able to score each score type in the game (two pairs, full house, 4 of a kind etc)
TODO:
  * as a user, we should be able to play a solitaire game.
  * as a user, we should be able to play with other people.
  * as a user, we should be able to compete against a computer.
